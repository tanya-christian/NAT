    1. Capture a TCP connection and identify SYN, SYN-ACK, and ACK.
     tcp.stream eq 0
Questions:
    • Which packets are SYN, SYN-ACK, and ACK?
Packet 1,2,3
    • What are the source and destination ports?
Source: 20000
Destination: 80
    • What is the initial sequence number?
ISN: 0


    2.  Find the size of TCP segments carrying application data.
       tcp.port == 80 || tcp.port == 443
Questions:
    • What is the payload length of the first 5 data packets?
Total length: 435
    • Identify any large payload segments.
	1538

    3.  Detects retransmitted segments in a capture.
       tcp.analysis.retransmission
Questions:
    • Which packet(s) were retransmitted?
Total Packets: 68
Src: 10.0.0.1 
dst:10.0.0.100
ISN: 9
    • What is the RTT for the retransmission?

    4. Identify duplicate ACKs in TCP.
      tcp.analysis.duplicate_ack
Questions:
    • How many duplicate ACKs were observed?
28
    • What sequence number do they acknowledge?
		Sequence no: 1

    5. Understand flow control in TCP.
  
Questions:
    • What is the advertised window size?
8192
    • How does window scaling affect throughput?
		-2 (2)^2 = 4
	8192 * 4
    6. Measure RTT of TCP segments and estimate using TCP formula.
               Statictis→Flow Graph->screenshot
Questions:
    • What is the RTT of the first 5 segments?
      screenshot
    • Compute Estimated RTT after each ACK.

    7. Detects packets received out-of-order.
           tcp.analysis.out_of_order
Questions:
    • Which packets arrived out-of-order?
      Total Packets: 21
      src: 10.0.0.1 
      dst: 10.0.0.100
      protocol: TCP
    • How did TCP handle them?
